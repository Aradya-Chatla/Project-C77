            Console application (app) is a program developed in Visual Studio which accepts input parameter, calls the 
            required service, runs business logic and sends output to the console, this console is known as the command
             prompt.A console application is primarily designed for the following reasons: To provide a simple user
              interface for applications requiring little or no user interaction, such as samples for learning C# 
              language features and command-line utility programs.The Visual Studio terminal is built on top of Windows 
              Terminal. To open the terminal in Visual Studio, choose View > Terminal.Add the System. Diagnostics 
              namespace, and then you can use Debug. WriteLine() to quickly print a message to the output window of
               the IDE.</p>
